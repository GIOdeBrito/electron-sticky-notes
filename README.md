# Electron Sticky Notes

This is a personal sticky notes project I made to mimicry another program
I used to use years agone. It is a real hassle to make it work on my Linux Mint
so I decided to make my own version of it.

# Build application

Run the script `build-and-extract` and after building the application inside
the container, it will extract the AppImage and other files the the `dist` directory.
